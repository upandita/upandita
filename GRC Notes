Entities are a game-changer for integrated risk management

Entity scoping is when an organization defines what people, places, or objects, such as processes, vendors, and departments, should be monitored for compliance and included in risk management. Then, these entities are mapped to a set of controls and to a set of risks. A mature entity framework helps an organization create an integrated risk management program with automatic workflows and informed, data driven decision-making.

It is important to understand that when scoping entities, the organization should use high-quality and reliable data, with the organizational layer built correctly.
